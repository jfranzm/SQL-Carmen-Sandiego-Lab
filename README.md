#### Use SQL to find Carmen Sandiego

We're going to use what we've learned already about querying a database using SQL commands to to chase down and capture an elusive and world-renowned thief, Carmen Sandiego!

## Exercise

The goal is to figure out what city Carmen Sandiego is heading to so that she can be met by the proper authorities.

You'll be writing SQL queries within `clues.sql` to answer each clue.

Run the queries in psql by typing `\i clues.sql`.
